    <details>
      <summary><b>What does this blueprint do?</b></summary>
      <p>
        <strong>Music Follow</strong> automatically groups your Sonos speakers to follow you as you move through your home.<br>
        When you enter a room, the music seamlessly joins you there. When you leave, it unjoins.<br>
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary><b>How to use</b></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Select all Sonos media players you want to include.</li>
        <li>Choose your presence sensors (one per room).</li>
        <li>Set your master player helper (an <code>input_text</code> entity).</li>
        <li>Optionally, enable a toggle helper (an <code>input_boolean</code> to turn the automation on/off).</li>
        <li>Set custom delay durations for presence triggers.</li>
        <li>Optionally, specify a volume and delay for lowering the volume after a room is vacated.</li>
      </ul>
